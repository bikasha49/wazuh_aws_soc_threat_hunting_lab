# Wazuh AWS SOC Threat Hunting Lab

## Project Summary
Built and operated a cloud based SIEM by deploying Wazuh on AWS EC2 and integrating a Windows Server 2022 endpoint. I configured secure communication, collected endpoint telemetry, enabled compliance and file integrity monitoring, enriched alerts with threat intelligence, mapped detections to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, and performed threat hunting using dashboards and event level analysis following a real SOC analyst workflow.

## Threat Detection Performed
• Authentication success and failure monitoring  
• Privilege escalation activity detection  
• Suspicious process and service execution  
• File modification and persistence behavior  
• Alerts mapped to MITRE ATT&CK techniques
### Mitre Att&ck Techniques

    width="60%">
</p>

## Threat Hunting Workflow
• Used dashboards to identify abnormal patterns  
• Pivoted from alerts to raw event data  
• Analyzed timestamps, users, and host context  
• Followed structured SOC investigation methodology  

### Threat Hunting Events

    width="60%">
</p>

## MITRE ATT&CK Alignment
• Mapped detections to tactics and techniques  
• Demonstrated visibility across the attack lifecycle  
• Used framework driven validation during investigations  

### Analytical Value

## File Integrity Monitoring
• Monitored critical Windows directories  
• Detected unauthorized file creation and changes  
• Generated real time alerts on modification events  

### FIN Alerts

## Configuration Assessment
• Applied CIS benchmark for Windows Server 2022  
• Identified security misconfigurations  
• Measured endpoint security posture
