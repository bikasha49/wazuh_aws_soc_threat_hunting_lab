# Cloud SIEM Threat Hunting and Detection using Wazuh and AWS

## Project Summary
Built and operated a cloud based SIEM by deploying Wazuh on AWS EC2 and integrating a Windows Server 2022 endpoint. I configured secure communication, collected endpoint telemetry, enabled compliance and file integrity monitoring, enriched alerts with threat intelligence, mapped detections to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, and performed threat hunting using dashboards and event level analysis following a real SOC analyst workflow.

## Project Objectives
• Build a cloud based SIEM environment  
• Detect real attack behavior on endpoints  
• Practice SOC analyst threat hunting workflow  
• Align detections with industry frameworks  

## Environment Setup
• Deployed Wazuh Manager on AWS EC2 Linux  
• Configured AWS security groups for controlled access  
• Enabled TLS encrypted agent to manager communication  
• Accessed Wazuh dashboard securely over HTTPS

## Threat Detection Performed
• Authentication success and failure monitoring  
• Privilege escalation activity detection  
• Suspicious process and service execution  
• File modification and persistence behavior  
• Alerts mapped to MITRE ATT&CK techniques

</p>

## Threat Hunting Workflow
• Used dashboards to identify abnormal patterns  
• Pivoted from alerts to raw event data  
• Analyzed timestamps, users, and host context  
• Followed structured SOC investigation methodology  
### Threat Hunting Events

## MITRE ATT&CK Alignment
• Mapped detections to tactics and techniques  
• Demonstrated visibility across the attack lifecycle  
• Used framework driven validation during investigations

## File Integrity Monitoring
• Monitored critical Windows directories  
• Detected unauthorized file creation and changes  
• Generated real time alerts on modification events  
### FIN Alerts <p align="left">

## Active Response
• Configured automated response rules  
• Blocked malicious source IP addresses  
• Validated response execution on the endpoint  

## Security Best Practices Applied
• Masked API keys and sensitive configuration values  
• Sanitized IP addresses for public sharing  
• Followed least exposure principles  
• Clearly documented lab versus production considerations
